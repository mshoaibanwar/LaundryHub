Laundry management is a time-consuming and cumbersome task that can cause many people to
experience inefficiencies, such as paying on-demand prices, waiting for pick-up and drop-off, and
the absence of door-to-door service. To address these issues, we propose a laundry management
system that provides a single, comprehensive marketplace where customers can compare prices
and connect digitally with Laundrymen.

The proposed solution is a mobile application that allows customers to request laundry services,
and Laundrymen to offer their services to customers. The mobile application includes features
such as real-time pricing, scheduling, and tracking, as well as a rating and review system that
enables customers to provide feedback about the Laundrymen.
The proposed laundry automation system provides a socially responsible way to manage laundry
by providing an opportunity for women and poor people to earn from the comfort of their homes.
This is achieved by allowing Laundrymen to work from home and accept laundry requests through
the mobile application. Furthermore, the system includes a Rider feature that provides door-todoor service, ensuring that customers do not have to waste time waiting for pick-up or drop-off.

The development of the proposed laundry management system involves the use of digital
technologies and tools such as mobile application development, and digital marketing. The
system's development also involves a comprehensive analysis of the laundry management market,
including customer needs and preferences, market trends, and existing solutions.
Overall, the proposed laundry management system offers a convenient and socially responsible
way to manage laundry, addressing the needs of both customers and service providers. The system
will revolutionize the laundry management market by providing a comprehensive and userfriendly platform that connects customers, Laundrymen, and Riders.
